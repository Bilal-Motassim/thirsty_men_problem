Solution Using Death Roll Gambling: 

The death roll game determines the order of cup placement in the row to allocate the two cups of water. 
All guests take turns rolling a die or using a random number generator with a maximum range Example (1-6 or 1-1000).
The result of each roll becomes the upper limit for the next roll. 
The first player to roll a 1 is eliminated but places their cup at the first position in the row, securing the first cup of water. 
The game continues, with each eliminated player placing their cup in the next available position, until only one player remains. 
The last player standing places their cup at the last position in the row, securing the last cup of water. 
The host then pours water into the first and last cups. 
At the end, the winners of the first and last cups can choose to share the water with others or be selfish and keep it for themselves. 
This method combines randomness with clear rules, ensuring a fair distribution while maintaining the integrity of the host's pouring rules.


Example:

Participants: 4 guests: G1, G2, G3, G4.

Starting the Game:
    All 4 guests roll a die in turn, starting with a maximum range of (1-6).
    G1 rolls a 4 out of 6, G2 rolls a 3 out of 4, G3 rolls a 2 out of 3, and G4 rolls a 1 out of 2.

First Elimination:
    G4 rolls a 1, is eliminated, and places their cup at the first position in the row securing the first cup.

Continuing the Game:
    The remaining players (G1, G2, G3) continue rolling.
    G2 rolls a 1 next, is eliminated, and places their cup at the second position.
    G1 and G3 keep rolling until G3 rolls a 1.

Final Standing:
    G3 is eliminated and places their cup at the third position.
    G1 is the last player standing and places their cup at the last position securing the last cup.

  
Outcome:
    The host pours water into G4's cup (first position) and G1's cup (last position).
    G4 and G1 can decide to share the water with others or drink it themselves.
